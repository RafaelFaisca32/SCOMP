| SIGTSTP       | 20 | Signal sent to a process by its controlling terminal to request it to stop (terminal stop). It is commonly initiated by the user pressing Ctrl+Z. Unlike SIGSTOP, the process can register a signal handler for, or ignore, the signal. |
| SIGTTIN       | 21 | Signal sent to a process when it attempts to read in from the **tty** while in the background.                                                                                                                                          |
